# Footage-to-Animation
Demonstration of footage to animation ML based project I've been working on for the past two years. The project is currently in pre-alpha

The project will be uploaded at a later point when ready for consumer use, for the moment the latest demo video can be seen here:

The goal of the project is to create a live-action footage-to-animation converter that takes subtle facial expressions and cues into account, and it operates on a high level.
Other footage to animation conversion softwares today operate either on a pixel basis, which, from observation, hampers the reproduction of micro movements and expressions, or rely on more binary states - such as classification of mouth phoneme shapes, eye states (closed / open), and deltas of movements (moving left, right, up, down) to control the movement of their animated faces, as opposed to directly mimicing the actual movement of the person in the footage.
